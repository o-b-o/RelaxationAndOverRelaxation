# RelaxationAndOverRelaxation
Code to find the potential generated by a set of charges through the use of a relaxation algorithm

The included image is an example of when this diverges lol but the ones that work are too big so you'll have to run the code to get them sweet animations!

capacitor.c models thangs with the Jacobi method

hippy.c implements overrelaxation with parameter alpha

hippy2.c implements the same thing but with dynamic boundaries
