# RelaxationAndOverRelaxation
Code to find the potential generated by a set of charges through the use of a relaxation algorithm

The code depends on gnuplot to generate animations showing the matrix converging to the solution. Animations may be big.

capacitor.c models things with the Jacobi method

hippy.c implements overrelaxation with parameter alpha

hippy2.c implements the same thing but with dynamic boundaries
